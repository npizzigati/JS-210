// Guessing the Password
// Write a password guessing program that tracks how many times
// the user enters the wrong password. If the user enters the
// password wrong three times, log 'You have been denied access.'
// and terminate the program. If the password is correct, log
// 'You have successfully logged in.' and end the program.

// Example
// Copy Code
// // password = 'password'

// // The program displays a dialog that asks the user to enter a password.
// // If the user enters the wrong password, keep asking up to three times. After
// // three failures, log the access denied.

// What is the password: 123
// What is the password: opensesame
// What is the password: letmein

// // message on the console
// You have been denied access.

// // If the user enters the right password, report login success.
// What is the password: password

// // message on the console
// You have successfully logged in.
